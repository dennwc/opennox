Some russian text from the russian CSF is garbage (but not all, which is weird!).

The doors on the minimap are not all drawn (only some are drawn, while others are absent).

The barbarian archer shoots in the wrong direction in the scripted room with explosives in the map wiz03a
This problem seems to be global, as all directional projectiles fly in the wrong direction (ie MoM when targeted to the east flies toward the west)

The information about durability is borked, showing 0/somehugenumber. The durability system itself seems to work though

The staff of oblivion animation is garbage. Totally garbage.

Conjurer can take control of unlimited number of animals (either by charming or by creating them)

The game hangs (but does not crash) when clicking the column name in the network game selection window

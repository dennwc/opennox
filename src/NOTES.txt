In the upper left corner the cursor seems to be on top of a closed inventory pane, blocking actions in that zone.

It seems that the inventory isn't getting the flag 0x200 for skip cursor update. Also the inventory is composed of multiple elements, so we need to set the flag on all of them on both open (467BB0?) and close (467C10?). Memory initialization and update is still not found yet

GAME2.c 23042 && GAME2.c 23049

Possibly inventory creation: sub_465E00

GAME2.c 16644 open inventory
GAME2.c 16654 close inventory


0x1053fdc0
0x10541170

It seems that different hower functions are called in vanilla and here. sub_4667E0 in vanilla and sub_466E20 on this. Both doesn't have the flag 0x200 though.
